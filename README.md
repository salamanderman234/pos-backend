# POS API
This is backend system for pos application that I develop for my personal project. 
## Documentation
Developed using go language and it is an API based system. I'm using clean architechture for this project mainly for scalabillity issues which I thought would be a major issue if I used the mvc pattern that I usually use. Soon, I'll provide some proper documentation about all endpoints and all explanation of my decision for this project so stay tune !
